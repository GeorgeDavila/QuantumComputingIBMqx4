Quantum Computing Algorithms Implemented on IBM's 4-Qubit Hardware 



Presentations regarding Theory & Implementation of Grover's Algorithm done in association with ALI AL KOBAISI & TYRONE THAMES for graduate Quantum Computing class in Spring 2018 at the University of Central Florida. The code for Grover's algorithm posted here was written by George Davila but in parallel with ALI AL KOBAISI & TYRONE THAME writing code for similar end.
